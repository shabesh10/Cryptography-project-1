## A simple CLI based Caesar cipher project built using java
## Check out my [article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/cryptography-explained-how-protects-our-digital-world-shabeshvaran-s-d3kec) about cryptography 
### Features
- Encrypts and decrypts text using Caesar cipher
- Supports custom shift values
- Command-line interface for ease of use

### Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher

### Example

First, encrypt a text and then copy that output and try to decrypt it, like the one below:
After running the program in your IDE


Type "encrypt" for encryption process and "decrypt" for decryption process: encrypt
Enter the word to be encrypted: code red
Enter the shift value: 7
Encrypted word: jvkl ylk      

Type "y" to do again and "n": y
Type "encrypt" for encryption process and "decrypt" for decryption process: decrypt
Enter the word to be decrypted: jvkl ylk
Enter the shift value: 7
Decrypted word: code red      

Type "y" to do again and "n": n
